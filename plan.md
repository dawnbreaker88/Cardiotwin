The updated project integrates a pre-trained cardiotoxicity prediction model stored as a serialized .pkl file, allowing the system to perform predictions without retraining the machine learning algorithm. During application startup, this model file is loaded into memory using a deserialization library such as joblib. This ensures that the same trained parameters and decision boundaries are preserved across different executions of the project.

To correctly interact with the loaded model, the project defines a fixed feature schema that exactly matches the structure used during model training. Each feature is given a clear, standardized name that reflects its clinical meaning and measurement unit. For example, demographic features are labeled as age_years and sex_binary; vital-sign measurements are represented as resting_heart_rate_bpm, systolic_bp_mmHg, diastolic_bp_mmHg, and heart_rate_variability_rmssd; cardiac baseline indicators are named qtc_interval_ms and baseline_lvef_percent; and treatment exposure variables are defined as chemo_cycles_count, dose_per_cycle_mg_per_m2, and cumulative_dose_mg_per_m2. Maintaining identical naming, ordering, and data types is essential, because any mismatch between training features and prediction inputs would produce incorrect or failed predictions.

Within the user interface, these features are presented as structured input fields so that patient information can be entered in a clear and guided manner. After validation, the entered values are converted into a tabular data structure aligned with the predefined feature schema and then passed to the loaded .pkl model. The model returns probability scores for each cardiotoxicity category, which are subsequently mapped to human-readable labels: Low Risk, Moderate Risk, and High Risk. These results, along with confidence values, are displayed in the project interface to provide an interpretable clinical decision-support output.

Overall, this integration approach ensures consistency, reproducibility, and usability, transforming the trained machine learning model into a deployable component of the cardiotoxicity risk prediction system.
